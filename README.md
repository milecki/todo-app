A small project made with React 17 with Hooks (sucha as useState, useEffect, and useRef) developed using Create React App environment.

## Features

- Add new todo
- Delete todo
- Set todo as completed
- Set todo as priority (using star icon)
- Edit todo text using dialog prompt
- Display todos by category (All, Completed, Active, Priority)
